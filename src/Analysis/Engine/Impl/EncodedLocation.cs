    /// Simple structure used to track positions coming from multiple formats w/o having
    /// to resolve the location until much later.  We store a location resolver which can
    /// turn a location object back into a a line and column number.  Usually the resolver
    /// will be a PythonAst instance and the Location will be some Node.  The PythonAst
    /// then provides the location and we don't have to turn an index into line/column
    /// during the analysis.
    /// 
    /// But there's also the XAML analysis which doesn't have a PythonAst and Node, instead
    /// it just has line/column info.  So it uses a singleton instance and boxes the Location
    /// as a SourceLocation.  Because it's the uncommon case the extra overhead there isn't
    /// as important.
    /// 
    /// This ultimately lets us track the line/column info in the same space as just
    /// storing the line/column info directly while still allowing multiple schemes
    /// to be used.
