# Microsoft Python Language Server

Microsoft Python Language Server implements the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification).

Its primary clients are the [Python extension for VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python) and [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS).

Feel free to file issues or ask questions on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server/issues), and we welcome code contributions.

## Linting options (diagnostics)

The language server implements diagnostics (or linting), which runs on user code.
The following diagnostics are supported:

| Code | Description |
| - | - |
| `inherit-non-class` | Attempted to inherit something that is not a class. |
| `too-many-function-arguments` | Too many arguments have been provided to a function call. |
| `too-many-positional-arguments-before-star` | Too many arguments have been provided before a starred argument. |
| `parameter-already-specified` | A argument with this name has already been specified. |
| `parameter-missing` | A required positional argument is missing. |
| `positional-argument-after-keyword` | A positional argument has been provided after a keyword argument. |
| `return-in-init` | Encountered an explicit return in `__init__` function. |
| `typing-generic-arguments` | An error occurred while constructing `Generic`. |
| `typing-typevar-arguments` | An error occurred while constructing `TypeVar`. |
| `typing-newtype-arguments` | An error occurred while constructing `NewType`. |
| `unknown-parameter-name` | The keyword argument name provided is unknown. |
| `unresolved-import` | An import cannot be resolved, and may be missing. |
| `undefined-variable` | A variable has been used that has not yet been defined. |
| `variable-not-defined-globally` | A variable is not defined in the global scope. |
| `variable-not-defined-nonlocal` | A variable is not defined in non-local scopes. |

[A full list can be seen in the source code.](src/Analysis/Ast/Impl/Diagnostics/ErrorCodes.cs)

Linting can be controlled via the user configuration. In VS Code, this is `settings.json`, but other
clients would send this via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`.

If `python.linting.enabled` is set to `false` in the user configuration, then no diagnostics
will be collected other than syntax errors and unresolved imports.

To control the visibility and severity of the diagnotics, there are a number of lists
that can be set in the user configuration which make use of each diagnostic's error code.

| Setting | Description |
| - | - |
| `python.analysis.errors` | Diagnostics which should be shown as errors. |
| `python.analysis.warnings` | Diagnostics which should be shown as warnings. |
| `python.analysis.information` | Diagnostics which should be shown as informational. |
| `python.analysis.disabled` | Diagnotics which should not be shown at all. |

An example of a user configuration which sets these options:

```json
{
    "python.analysis.errors": ["undefined-variable"],
    "python.analysis.warnings": ["unknown-parameter-name"],
    "python.analysis.information": ["unresolved-import"],
    "python.analysis.disabled": ["too-many-function-arguments", "parameter-missing"],
}
```

Linting can also be controlled on an invidual line basis with a generalized `#noqa`. Lines with `#noqa` will have their diagnostic output suppressed.

An example usage:

```python
from python import language_server  # noqa will suppress the linting message for this line
```

## Cache location

During analysis language server produces Python code from compiled modules and builtins which is similar to Python module stubs.
It may also produce database files holding module analysis for faster retrieval later. Cache location is at

**Windows**

`"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Python Language Server"` (which is `Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData`). Typically `"C:\Users\\%USER_NAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Python Language Server"`

**Linux**

`"$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Microsoft/Python Language Server"`, or if `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is not set, `"$HOME/.cache/Microsoft/Python Language Server"`

**macOS**

`"$HOME/Library/Caches/Microsoft/Python Language Server"`
